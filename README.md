## Server


# Build and run

Currently the version available on the source control doesn't contain the 'dist' folder with assests and main JS server file.

To start the server on local machine run script:
    npm run dev

    NOTE: Make sure the CWD on CLI is 'project-scacchi/server' and the environment varaibles are added in root directory (in .env file).

This creates 'dist' directory after the build is complete (compiling TS files and copying required assets).


# Environment Variables Used

1. PORT (local machine development port number)
